# MarginGAN
This repository is the implementation of the paper "MarginGAN: Adversarial Training in Semi-Supervised Learning".
1."preliminary" is the implementation of **Preliminary Experiment on MNIST** of the paper. Thank the authors of [pytorch-generative-model-collections](https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-generative-model-collections) and [examples of pytorch] (https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/main.py), our code is widely adapted from their repositories.

2."Combined with Mean Teacher" is the implementation of **MarginGAN Combined with Mean Teacher** of the paper. Thank the authors of [mean teacher](https://github.com/CuriousAI/mean-teacher), our code is widely adapted from their repositories.
